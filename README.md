> Next.js/Nuxt alternative.

Modular framework for architectural freedom.


## View: benefits [flexible]

- Your stack, your choice.
  > Enjoy archtiectural freedom and choose any UI framework (React/Vue/Solid...), backend, deployement, data fetching (RPC/GraphQL/REST/...), and rendering strategy (SSR/SPA/SSG/...).
  > Pick Vike extensions to quickly integrate tools, while later if the need arises eject extensions for full control over tools integration.

- Cutting edge, at your own pace.
  > Pick Vike extensions that implement well-established approaches, or use cutting-edge extensions. Vike's flexible core supports both: conservative stacks as well cutting-edge stacks.
  > Vike doesn't enforce you the bleeding edge, but you can live on the edge in unprecedented ways if you choose to.

- Build Your Own Framework.
  > Vike adapts to your company requirements, not the other way around.
  > Vike's core is so flexible that you can build your own framework to exactly match your requirements.

- Flexible, by design and priority.
  > Vike is designed from the high-level down to little details to be flexible.
  > We also prioritize resolving blocking issues and feature requests.


## View: benefits [reliable]

- Adopt the future.
  > Vike's flexible core enables it to adapt to the fast evolving JavaScript ecosystem. Whether it'd be new approaches with data-fetching, Server Components or deployement strategies, Vike's do-one-thing-do-it-well archtiecture can quickly adapt to whatever comes next.
  > Progressively migrate one stack component and one page at a time, instead of having one big never-ending migration of everything at once. In other words: place your bets in one framework that can naturally and progressively adopt your requirements and the future.

- Transparent business model.
  > Vike introduces a new business model we call "Open Source Pricing" that keeps code 100% open source (MIT license) and 100% gratis for software engineers while asking companies to pay a small amount.
  > For a transparent and sustainable relationship between Vike and its users.

- Reliable, by care.
  > We quickly and systematically fix bugs (usually under 24 hours).
  > We are responsive, and we provide a clear guideline on how to reach out and get reliable help from us.
